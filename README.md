# Housing-Dataset
Multiple linear regression project

 You will build this model for a housing data set and predict the price of a house using the various potential predictor variables provided.
 You will first read and visualise your data set and then prepare your data for building a linear model.
 This will include dealing with categorical variables, adding dummy variables, and scaling. 
 You will then start building the model with a bottom-up approach, i.e., you will start with one variable and keep on adding more. 
 Once all the variables have been added, you will perform a manual feature elimination and move on to the residual analysis and predictions, as usual. 
 In the end, you will solve the same problem using RFE.

Problem Statement

Consider that a real estate company has the data on real estate prices in Delhi. The company wants to optimise the selling price of the properties based on important factors such as area, bedrooms, parking, etc.

Essentially, the company wants the following:

To identify the variables affecting house prices, e.g., area, number of rooms, bathrooms, etc.
To create a linear model that quantitatively relates house prices with variables, such as the number of rooms, area, number of bathrooms, etc.
To know the accuracy of the model, i.e., how well these variables predict the house prices.
